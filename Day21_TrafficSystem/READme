 The program loads 5 vehicles’ IDs, speeds, and lane numbers into arrays.
 It checks each vehicle to see if its speed is above 80 (speed violation).
 It also checks if the vehicle is not in the lane matching its ID % 4 (lane violation).
 It counts total speed violations, lane violations, and finds the busiest and least-busy lanes.
 Finally, it prints a full report showing all vehicles and the violation summary.
